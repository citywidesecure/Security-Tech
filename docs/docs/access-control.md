# Access Control Systems

Controlling who enters a facility is one of the most critical parts of physical security. At Citywide, we use modern access control systems to ensure only authorized personnel can enter secured areas.

## Features We Use

- 🔑 Keyless entry via RFID cards or mobile credentials  
- 🧠 Biometric scanners (fingerprint, facial recognition where permitted)  
- ⏰ Time-based permissions (e.g., restrict access after hours)  
- 📱 Remote management via centralized dashboard  
- 🚨 Real-time alerts on unauthorized attempts  

## Benefits

- Eliminate lost keys and unauthorized copying  
- Monitor and log all entries digitally  
- Instantly revoke access if needed  
- Seamless integration with other security systems  

We tailor these systems based on client needs — from single-door setups to enterprise-level multi-location rollouts.
